Run:ai Cluster Installation Guide
This article explains the steps required to install the Run:ai cluster on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

Before Installation
There are a number of matters to consider prior to installing using Helm.

System and Network Requirements
Before installing the Run:ai cluster, validate that the system requirements and network requirements are met.

Once all the requirements are met, it is highly recommended to use the Run:ai cluster preinstall diagnostics tool to:

Test the system requirements in addition to failure points related to Kubernetes, NVIDIA, storage, and networking.
Analyze additional components installed and their relevance to a successful installation.
To run the preinstall diagnostics tool, download the latest version from here .

SaaS Deployment

chmod +x ./preinstall-diagnostics-<platform> && \
./preinstall-diagnostics-<platform> \
  --domain ${COMPANY_NAME}.run.ai \
  --cluster-domain ${CLUSTER_FQDN}

Self-Hosted Deployment

chmod +x ./preinstall-diagnostics-<platform> && \
./preinstall-diagnostics-<platform> \
  --domain ${CONTROL_PLANE_FQDN} \
  --cluster-domain ${CLUSTER_FQDN} \
  --image-pull-secret ${IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME} \
  --image ${PRIVATE_REGISTRY_IMAGE_URL}


Airgap Deployment

In an air-gapped deployment, the diagnostics image is saved, pushed, and pulled manually from the organization's registry.

# Save the image locally
docker save --output preinstall-diagnostics.tar gcr.io/run-ai-lab/preinstall-diagnostics:${VERSION}

# Load the image to the organization's registry
docker load --input preinstall-diagnostics.tar
docker tag gcr.io/run-ai-lab/preinstall-diagnostics:${VERSION} ${CLIENT_IMAGE_AND_TAG}
docker push ${CLIENT_IMAGE_AND_TAG}

Run the binary with the --image parameter to modify the diagnostics image to be used:

chmod +x ./preinstall-diagnostics-darwin-arm64 && \
./preinstall-diagnostics-darwin-arm64 \
  --domain ${CONTROL_PLANE_FQDN} \
  --cluster-domain ${CLUSTER_FQDN} \
  --image-pull-secret ${IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME} \
  --image ${PRIVATE_REGISTRY_IMAGE_URL}

Helm
Run:ai cluster requires Helm 3.14 or above. To install Helm, see Helm Install .

Permissions
A Kubernetes user with the cluster-admin role is required to ensure a successful installation. For more information, see Using RBAC authorization .

Run:ai Namespace
Run:ai cluster must be installed in a namespace named runai. Create the namespace by running:

kubectl create ns runai

TLS Certificates
A TLS private and public key are required for HTTP access to the cluster. Create a Kubernetes Secret named runai-cluster-domain-tls-secret in the runai namespace with the clusterâ€™s Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) private and public keys by running:

kubectl create secret tls runai-cluster-domain-tls-secret -n runai \
    --cert /path/to/fullchain.pem \
    --key /path/to/private.pem

Installation
Follow these instructions to install using Helm.

Adding a New Cluster
Follow the steps below to add a new cluster.

Note: When adding a cluster for the first time, the New Cluster form automatically opens when you log in to the Run:ai platform. Other actions are prevented until the cluster is created. 

In the Run:ai platform, go to Resources .
Click +NEW CLUSTER .
Enter a unique name for your cluster.
Optional: Choose the Run:ai cluster version (latest, by default).
Enter the Cluster URL. For more information, see Domain Name Requirement .
Click Continue .
Installing Run:ai Cluster
Follow the installation instructions and run the commands provided on your Kubernetes cluster.
Click DONE .
The cluster is displayed in the table with the status Waiting to connect . Once installation is complete, the cluster status changes to Connected .

Note: To customize the installation based on your environment, see Customize cluster installation . 

Troubleshooting
Installation
If the Run:ai cluster installation failed, check the installation logs to identify the issue. Run the following script to print the installation logs:

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-ai/public/main/installation/get-installation-logs.sh

Cluster Status
If the Run:ai cluster installation completed but the cluster status did not change to Connected , check the cluster troubleshooting scenarios .
